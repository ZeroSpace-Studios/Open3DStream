Background
==========

This project creates a simple and unified way to allow devices and 
software applications to easily exchange 3d realtime animation data.  Communication
classes are provided to simplify the setup of network connections and math routines 
are provided to convert data between representations (euler/quaternion, z-up/y-up)

While theoretically any time sampled or event data that is taken from the real world
and needs to be transmitted is considered, the focus of this project is on data
captured by mobile devices (AR Kit, Accelerometer, GPS), Motion/Performance capture
and Virtual Production (Camera Intrinsic/Extrinsic)

**Issues with current implementations**

* Each application uses a different wire protocol or custom api
* No one wire protocol supports all wanted data for streaming 3d data.
* Different applications and devices use different data representations (units, rotation order, axis, etc)

**What does the standard aim to achieve**

* Define the wire protocol for real-time streaming applications
* A standard library may be used to achieve this rather than writing a new one
* Abstract the data from the context providing automatic type conversion and range checking (units, coordinate systems, euler/quaternions)
* Define an extensible system that so system itself doesnâ€™t need to change in order to add new data types
* Optimize transmission by sending the schemas or hierarchy separate from the data. This can be sent once at the start, at an interval, on request, or whenever a change is made
* The per frame message can contain data that alerts the endpoints that the structure has changed (for instance)
* Send real-time data as a buffer of plain data that can be correlated to the template/schema on the receiving end.

**Existing Standards**

* VRPN
* Unreal Live Link - message bus
* RTTrPM

**Requirements**

* Lightweight - bare minimum of dependencies for building
* Easy to implement and use
* Platform and transport agnostic
* Transport options include zeromq and nng
* Transport binary messages
* Allow encryption of binary messages
* Define a set of network transports used to send a block of data

**Example**

* Use off the shelf serialization/deserialization
* Quality of service control
